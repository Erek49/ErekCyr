              LORD OURZON'S RESIGNATION.
              The- reoeipt of the fall text of the despatch-
              es that have passed between the Vioeroy
              and the Secretary of State for India mak<M it
              only too dear that Lord Canon’s resignation
              is the outcome of a protracted straggle with
              the military polioy of Lord Kitohener of
              Khartoum, supported, as it was, by the Home
              Government. No doubt most of our readen have
              followed the oourse of Indian events olosely
              enough to be aware of the eisential features of
              what; was, in reality, a duel over a question
              of prinoipls fought by two of the ablest
              and most distinguished men of the day but
              Jjrief summary of tbeir respective posi
              Cions may be of interest. Lord Kitohener
              oame to India an avowed reformer: the
              South Afrioan War had shown England the
              necessity for thorough preparation for war in
              every branch of the land service, and, unlike
              the nation, Lord Kitohener did not forget the
              lesson. Realising that the embarrassments of
              Russia in the Par Bast gave India a breathing
              ■paoe tor a thorough military reorganisation,
              end realising too that tht overthrow of Mosoo-
              rite ambitions on the Pacific would probably
              drive the northerners to fight their way south
              through Persia and Beluchiston to the open
              water, he determined to reorganise the Indian
              Army in a manner that seemed to him most
              in aocordanoe with the teaching of modern war
              fare. The position in which’the great Anglo
              Egyptian soldier found himsblf, was hardly
              calculated to satisfy a masterful mind that
              was impressed by the necessity of acting
              rapidly and decisively. Though a member of
              the Vioeroy’s Council by virtue of his position
              as Commander-in-Chief, he found his sugge-
              tions liable to bp criticised by the “Military
              Member,” whose duty it was to review the
              suggestions and plans of the Commander
              in-chief, and report thereon to the Vioeroy.
              The “Military Member” was his junior in rank
              and, on occasion, his oritio, and it was obvious
              that a less masterful man than Lord Kitohener
              might well have oomplained of the obstructions
              which the system opposed to any rapid reform.
              In oonseqnenoe of his representations a com
              mittee on Indian Army Administration was
              formed last May. It oontained two former
              Commanders-in-Ghief in India, in Lord Roberts
              and Sir George White, it sought the opinion
              of a large number of distinguished Anglo-
              Indian civilians and soldiers, and found that
              (we quote the words -of the report;
              “while custom and oonvenienoe have assigned
              a practically unique position to the Com-
              mander-in Chief in regard to the Indian Go-
              vernment, his actual position in the official
              hierarchy is anomalous. The orders of the
              Government of India, are oonveyed to him by
              the Military Department, which is presided
              over by an offioer of jnnior rank and poasibly
              of inferior military attainments and exper-
              ience to himself This officer, who for many
              years past has been a Major-General, has as
              Secretary to the Government in his Depart-
              ment another offioer, also reoently a Major-
              General, who has not only the offioe ofoon-
              veying to the Commander-in-Chief the deci-
              sions of the Government of India, bnt oan
              himself be consulted, without reference to
              his immediate ohief, by the Vioeroy on any
              military' question. The Commander-in-Chief
              has therefore, between himself and the Vioeroy,
              two officers of junior rank, both of whom
              are entitled to oritioise all his proposals from
              a military standpoint It is obvious that such
              a procedure oan only be worked satisfactorily
              by those conoerned if very special tact and
              judgment are shown on both sides.”
              Lord Canon, on the other hand, pro-
              tested that the nature of his own functions
              made him responsible for all that the Com-
              mander-in-Chief did, and that he required
              expert advice to be able to criticise and oontrol
              his suggestions. He further pointed out that
              in the oase of a Commander-in-Chief who was
              ignorant of Indian conditions, and more
              especially of the preferences and prejjndioes of
              the native Army, the presence of a military
              oritio who had a long Indian experience was
              essential to the Counoil. Nona the lea* he was
              overruled and offered to resign his position in
              June, but finally ^decided to aooept a compro-
              mise by whioh the “Military Member” was not
              to oonoem himself with purely military matters,
              but to oonfine his advioe to questions referring
              to military supply and finanoe. 'Friotion reoom-
              menoed when .Lord Canon strongly reoom
              mended Major General Sir R Barrow, a dis-
              tinguished frontier offioer, for the post of Mili-
              tary Member. Tho Seoretary of State for India
              opposed theVioeroy’s suggestion on the ground
              that this offioer would be required for high
              exeoutive command in oase of war. On the 5th
              inat the Vioeroy replied that the Home
              Government ywas denying him the oohfidenoe
              that alone would enable him to serve them
              with snooess in rajeoting his reoommsodation,
              and again offered his resignation. Mr. Balfour
              then intervened and pointed out that the duty
              of advising the King as tq the appointment of
              mem ben of the Council rested with the Secre-
              tary of State, and that “no greater violation of ;
              the Constitution oonld well be imagined than
              that this dqty should degenerate into a merely
              formal submission to his Majesty of the views
              aud recommendations of the Vioeroy.”
              We need not follow the dispute to its olose.
              Lord Canon offered his resignation and it was
              regretfully aooepted by the Premier.The strong-
              est of reoent Indian Viceroys had failed to per-
              suade the British Government to aooept his

              Chamber are always at the disposal of any
              member desiring information on trade matters
              generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents.
              As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the
              interests of all British traders here to become members,
              especially when it is remembered that the
              annual subscription is merely the nominal one

              <p>As every resident in this country is aware

              has been celebrated - from time immemorial
              by an important festival at this period of
              the year. It.is not simply a poetical metaphor,
              but an axiomatic fact which requires no proof
              that the Nile is the Providence of Egypt,
              and therefore it is not surprising, that as a
              time of universal rejoicing by the native portion
              of the population of this cosmopolitan country,.
              the Khalig fête outshines most of the great
              religious festivals.</p>

              <p>This time-honored celebration took place
              at Old Cairo on Saturday with the customary
              festivities. From early afternoon the Tramway
              Company, which had organised a special service
              of trams to Foum-el-Khalig, brought down
              crowds of visitors from all parts of the city;
              and by nine o’clock, when the official
              ceremony commenced, there were many thousands
              of people to witness the illuminations of the
              river craft and grounds, and the fireworks.
              According to an old custom, previous to the
              arrival of the Khedive’s representative the
              Ulemas of the El Azhar were entertained at
              a banquet. In the unavoidable absence of
              H. E Fakhry Pasha, the Acting Regent, his
              place was taken by H. K Ibrahim Pasha
              Naguib, the under Secretary of State of the
              Ministry of the Interior, who presided at the
              ceremony and received the principal guests.
              In the part of the enclosure reserved for
              such as were favored with invitation cards
              there was a large number of officials, both
              European and Native, several Diplomatic and
              Consular representatives, officers of the Army
              of Occupation and the Egyptian Army, and
              last, but not least, quite a number of ladies.
              On the river, between the bank and the opposite
              Island of Rodah, the numerous small
              craft in the shape of steam pleasure-launch-es,
              dahabeahs, and large boats, were a
              very pretty sight when lit up with innumerable
              lights at night The illuminations on
              shore and decorations added a charm to
              a scene that was already picturesque and
              interesting. In seems a thousand pities that
              the ceremony should happen to fall at a
              time of the year when it is rarely witnessed
              by tourists, for it is a sight that
              would impress a visitor as one of great beauty,
              and give him a good idea of a real native fantasia.
              The display of fireworks was much
              appreciated, more especially the set pieces,
              which seemed to astonish a large proportion of
              the Arab audience.</p>

              <p>In reality of late years the cutting of the
              Khalig is a misnomer for a ceremony that has
              no raison d’être, since the old canal that traversed
              and supplied the great city with water
              (over which a tramway line now runs for a
              greater part of the distance) has been filled up,
              for the ceremony was instituted to celebrate
              the cutting of the Khalig or dam that separates
              the canal from the river. Up to the time of
              the Khalifa Omar Ibn-el-Hattab, some 1,300
              years ago, it was the custom to celebrate the
              occasion by throwing into the river a young
              and beautiful virgin decked with jewels and this
              was done to propitiate the Evil One and appease
              his wrath. But at that period Amr Ibn-
              el-Aas, the Calipha’s Wali, stopped this barbarity
              and substituted for the real living virgin
              one made of clay, which custom was, it is said,
              still in vogue lees than century ago.</p>

              <p>The committee appointed to organise the
              fêtes to be held on September 1, in celebration
              of the twenty-ninth anniversary of the accession
              of the Sultan to his throne, are arranging a
              programme of altogether exceptional brilliancy,
              for they feel that the rejoicings on this occasion
              should be particularly universal in Egypt
              on account of His Majesty’s fortunate escape
              from the dastardly attempt upon his life.<p>

              <p>The committee hope, therefore, that the
              residents of Egypt of all nationalities will assist
              towards the success of the fêtes by buying
              tickets for the Esbekieh Gardens, and the
              Theatre. The prices of tickets will be as
              follows: </p>

              <p>Entrance to garden P.T. 5;</p>
              <p>Entrance to garden and tent, where there will be a concert, P.T. 10; </p>

              <p>Theatre tickets also admit to the gardens with the exception of
              those to the gallery. Tickets can now be purchased at the
              office at the Boulac entrance to
              the garden, at the New Bar, Splendid Bar,
              Opera Bar, and at the offioes of “El Lewa,’’

              <p>Cattle were driven through the rice fields
              and through some early sown berseem in order
              to destroy these crops. The esbeh was attacked
              and some half dozen of the men injured with
              pabouts, some seriously. Terrorism has caused
              the inhabitants meantime to seek refuge in
              another esbeh, abandoning the care of the
              crops, and irrigation of the land.</p>

              <p>The property belongs to Englishmen and as

              <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.</head>

              <head>THE RAILWAY IMPROVEMENTS.<head>

              <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>

              <right>Port Said, Saturday.</right>

              <div type="item">
              <p>Some time back I wrote regarding the
              large amount of work which is being done
              towards levelling, reclaiming and raising the
              land behind the Railway Station and that
              between the Bassins Cherif and Abbas. A visit
              to the railway station reveals great and numerous
              improvements in the traffic departments;
              commodious luggage and goods sheds have
              lately been completed fitted up with tables
              which are labelled with large letters for the
              purpose of sorting with facility. There are
              now five pairs of rails for passenger trains and
              two for goods, in connection with which last a
              bond shed has been built. Some 150 yards
              nearer the old cemetery, will, in about two
              years’ time, see the erection of another station,
              which is to be an improvement on the present
              one; but the old station will still be used.
              The land between the present metals and the
              lake is about three feet below the level of the
              station yards. This is now being raised some five
              five feet with land which is taken from
              Dowrie Point and the surroundings, and it is
              on this raised land that the new station
              is to be built. I am informed that 700,000
              cubic yards is the quantity of land required
              for filling in. This work, it is hoped, will be be
              concluded about next June, when the new
              station is to be at once taken in hand.</p>

              <head>LUGUBRIOUS SIGHTS.<head>
              At the extreme north east corner of Lake
              Menzaleh is situated the old cemetery, which
              has not been used for interment for some
              years past. In connection with the large
              improvements rapidly going on in this decidedly
              dirty and insanitary quarter of the town,
              the authorities, it appears, have granted permission
              to the relatives of those buried there,
              to remove the remains to the newer and more
              commodious burial ground; the result being
              that somewhat repelling sights are frequently
              to be witnessed, as the coffins are exhumed in
              daylight.</p>

              Stavros, who succumbed on Friday to an
              attack of anthrax. The deceased had only
              been in Port Said two months, having come
              from Beni Souef, Upper Egypt, to which place
              the remains were last evening conveyed in a
              special carriage by the 6:30 train. A large
              concourse attended the coffin to the railway
              station, where it arrived about 5 p.m.</p>

              </p>A serious affray brought about by an
              altercation between a man and woman, both
              Italian subjects, took place on Saturday after-
              noon at Gamh El Ahmar, in the Bab-el-Sharieh
              quarter of Cairo. As the woman called out for
              help several policemen ran to her assistance,
              whereupon three other Italians took the part
              of their countryman and attacked the police,
              two of the men drawing revolvers and firing
              indiscriminately at the crowd that had assembled.
              Kamel Effendi Haneim, an official of the
              Gouvernorat, on arriving at the scene of the
              disturbance was fired at and seriously wounded
              in the head. Three of the attacking party were
              finally overpowered and taken to the caracol,
              and the fourth, who took to fight on the
              arrest of the others, was arrested yesterday
              and handed over to his consular authority.</p>

              doit être fait aux créanciers de la Daïra Sanieh
              et a la veille de la liquidation des droits respectifs
              dérivant de la cession du 21 Juin 1898
              que L.L.A.A. les Princes, fils du Khédive
              Ismaïl, réclament judiciairemant, en prétendant
              que le Domaine de l’ancienne Daïra
              Sanieh, constituant un simple gage affecté a la
              garantie de l’emprunt Daïra, la réalisation de ,
              ce gage doit leur revenir, aprés remboursement
              de cet Emprunt.</p>


              <p>Le Domaine de l’anocienne Daïra Sanieh était
              la propriété de S.A. le Khédive Ismail qui
              avait incontestablement le droit d’en disposer
              a son gré.</p>


              <p>Par oontrat du 12 juillet 1877, S. A. le
              Khtédive Ismaïl affectait ce Domaine en hypothéque,
              pour garantir le service des intérêts
              et l’amortisaement de la dette générale de
              la Daïra Sanieh.</p>


              <p>Plus tard, en 1880, a é é promulguée la
              Loi de liquidation qui dispose formellement
              en son article 40:</p>


              <p>“Sont déclarées propriétés de l’Etat les pro-
              "priétés des Daïras Sanieh et Khassa, men
              “tionnées dans les états annexés au contrat
              “du 12 juillet 1877 ou dans les inscriptions |
              “prises en vertu de co contrat.”</p>


              <p>Voila qui est aussi net que catégorique.
              Le Domaine de l’ancienne Daïra Sanieh
              est devenu une propriété del’Etat: c’est dono
              dans la striote limits de ses attributions que
              le Gouvernement Egyptien, proprétaire, a
              conolu la convention sus-ana'ysée du 21 Juin
              1898 qui est aujourd’hui un fait accompli.</p>
