              We have no excuse and no apology to offer
              for having coonpied so many oolumns of onr
              special doable number of to-day with reports

              subscribers, who have avoided an exceptionally
              hot year by going home to England or the con-
              tinent, and have thus missed the solar eolipse
              —and the solar heat—oan console themselves
              with the possession of full descriptions of
              the event, as seen from various looalities
              whioh onr correspondents have forwarded us.
              Egypt will not see snoh a sight again for a
              generation at least, and the next total eolipse
              to visit the British Isles in 1927 wiH be con-
              fined to the Bast Coast of Inland and ths
              Northern Counties of England. Ths last total
              soUpstofthe sob visible in Hgypt took plaoe
              on May 17, 1882, when the "Egyptian Gazette"
              was in its infancy and bnt little notice was
              taken of the phenomenon either by this journal
              or by its local contemporaries. For this there
              was good reason: Egypt was in the throes of a
              military revolution of which none oonld see the
              end, Arabi and hiB oolonels were all powerful
              and within less than a month ot the darken-
              ing of the snn, Alexandria vu in mourning
              for the victims of the terrible riot whioh bronght
              about the bombardment,- the war and the
              British Ooonpation. Many of those, who took
              more than a passing interest in the eolipse
              of 1882 mast have fonnd it hard to resist
              the impression that this was an evil omen,
              a portent of war and ruin to the land over
              whioh it pasted. Yesterday all was at peace
              in the lands from which the eolipse was visi-
              ble, above all in Egypt, where no wars or
              rumours of wars disturbed a population that
              ias forgotten the "events" in its anxiety that
              eaoh year’s ootton crop should exoel the last,
              and, thanks to the presence of the European
              schoolmaster and, we may add, to the wide
              inorease of enlightenment among Moslem and
              Copt alike, the passing of the moon's shadow
              over the glowing disc was recorded without
              1 ear and with something more than mere
              ohildish wonder and perplexity. Nor were
              Europeans indifferent to the fascination of
              watching the dark shadow eat its way into
              the bright oirole of the sud. Laymen and
              scientific amateurs gazed at the sky, the most
              vigorous speculator forgot Nile—but we must
              avoid puffs even in onr purplest passages—
              while he made alarming facial contortions at
              the heavens through a disc of smoked glass,
              and np the Nile at red hot Assouan scientists
              of three nations took valuable records of the
              remarkable phenomena whioh aooompany every
              total eclipse. The Commissions, whatever their
              sufferings from the climate, had no atmospherio
              difficulties to oontend with, and they oonld
              sympathise with the sufferings of astronomers
              under other skies oondemned to see a large
              and inky olood bank hide the snn at the very
              moment of totality, or onrse the fickle olimate
              of the north when rain andmiat cover the sky
              all through that day of all others whioh should
              be dear and bright
              The conditions under whioh yesterday's
              eolipse took plaoe were supremely favorable to
              observers in Egypt, and we shall not be sur-
              prised to learn that the observations taken by
              the numerous and distinguished scientists at
              Assouan, have given highly snooessfnl results,
              and have contributed largely to onr knowledge
              of solar astronomy and physios. The study of
              the oorona, the measurement of its brightness
              at varying distances from the son’s oentre,
              the determination of the quantity of light
              that beoomes radially polarised, the photo-
              graphing of the field of view all round
              the eclipsed snn in the hope of finding
              a new planet even nearer than Meronryto
              the oentre of the solar system, and the
              attempt to prove whether, when the son’s
              light is screened, a portion of its magnetio rays
              are also ont off,—these are the ohief problems
              whioh scientists in Spain, Algeria, and Egypt
              set themselves to solve yesterday. We shall
              have to wait for the results of their observa-
              tions to be studied and oompared in the great
              observatories of Europe and America before
              we know all the additions made to astronomical
              and physical soienoe, bnt we feel confident
              that none of the commissions sent to solve
              these problems in Algeria and Spain will have
              the mortifying experience that once befell oer-
              tain German observers who ruefully oonfessed
              to Prince Bismarok that they had aohieved
              nothing. “Why 1 ’ asked the Chanoeller "The
              oloada hid the sun---” began the ohief of the
              party, to be ont short with an unfseling 1 Then
              you had better pay your own expenses.” But
              when an eolipse does visit Egypt and especially
              Upper Egypt there is every reason to count
              npon its being a speotaonlar and aoientifio suc-
              cess. We have, in the Oriental phrase, been
              honoured by the presence of some of the
              leaders of aatronomioal research, we have had
              the pleasant and flattering experience of seeing
              ►he sun darkened by the shadows of the world
              of whioh we form a part, we have had the satis-
              faction of "assisting" at an event that will be-
              recorded long after we have been forgotten,
              and that in our opinion, justifies the "Egyptian
              Gazette’^ in devoting as muoh space to the
              topio of the day as if its motto were—"Eclipse

<p>Assouan, Wednesday.</p>

<p>This afternoon’s eclipse was a thorongh
success, if I may be allowed to nse the expression,
and whatever the scientific results
obtained, there can be no doubt that the conditions
were as favorable to observation as
they well could be. The wind was very light,
and not a single cloud was visible during the
whole afternoon, though there a certain haziness
about. Haze was of course almost inevitable
at this season of the rising Nile flood,
but I have not been informed that it appreciably
interfered with observations. Numerous
observers were in the field. Besides the scientific
parties and commissions, not a few
energetic amateurs had braved the heat and
discomfort of a long railway journey to go
south to Assouan. Mr. Smyrnoff, the Russian
Diplomatic Agent in Egypt, Count Arrivabene
Gonzaga, the Acting Diplomatic Agent for
Italy, Graft Antonio von Stadnicki, Secretary
of Legation to the Austro-Hungarian Diplomatic
Agency, and M. Roman Ertbuer, secretary
to the Belgian Consulate General, left
Cairo on Monday evening and arrived at the
Savoy Hotel last night, while Mr. Mitchell
Innes, who gives a dinner to all the astronomical
missions to-night, Mr. A. L. Webb,
C.M.G., and Mr. Courtenay Clifton were also
among the spectators. The Egyptian Government
mission was divided. Mr. Wade
watched the eclipse from a height west of
Assouan, while Mr. Freeman’s station was
near Edfou, and Mr. Macpherson and Youssef
Etfendi Fordi were at Dauhid south of the
first cataract.</p>

<p>The members of the various scientific missions
were early on the ground. Special policemen
and barriers of rope kept the meet carious
at a distance from the astronomers and their
instruments, and long before the eclipse began
all was in the most perfeot readiness for the
great event.</p>

<p>   At 3.26 p.m. came the moment of first contract
      and thereafter the black line of the
      moon’s shadow gradually gained on the glowing
      brightness of the sun. The progress of the
      eclipse was followed with intense interest and
      it must have seemed years to the more impatient
      observers before the phase of totality was
      reached at 4.36 p.m. For two minutes and
      twenty four seconds the sun was completely
      hidden. Several stars were plainly visible and
      the planet Mars was remarkably conspicuous.
      Animal life was absolutely still in the gloom,
      but for one flock of birds that passed overhead.</p>

<p>
  The corona afforded a most interesting
  study. The streamers were most prominent in
  the sun spot zones, the western streamers being
  shorter and more divergent, the longest, being
  quite two diameters of the sun in length. Short
  streamers of light were also visible proceeding
  from the north and south polar extremities
  of the sun. The prominences noticed were
  particularly large, especially those which
  issued from the western side of the obscured
  sun.
</p>

<p>
  Then the bright edge of the sun began to
  emerge and the important part of the eclipse
  was over. Nothing is known as yet of the
  results obtained by the scientists who were at
  work in recording magnetic observation, and as
  the photographic results await development it
  is impossible to give anything like a complete
  description of what has actually been recorded
  by the instruments. Further details will follow;
  in the meantime the eclipse may be pronounced
  a success from every point of view.

  <head>AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
  <p>
  In Alexandria, as in every other town and
  village of Egypt, a keen interest was taken in
  the eclipse, which was the topic of the day in
  some circles, and in others was a close second
  either to the Peace or the effects of M.
  Cronier’s suicide. Interest, indeed, is hardly
  a strong enough term for the emotions that was
  stirred in the breasts of many Alexandrians by
  the realisation of the fact that at one minute
  to three in the afternoon a partial eclipso of
  the sun would commence, without fail, — for
  such events are never postponed—and that led
  even bootblacks and marmitons to arm themselves
  with pieces of smoked glass. As the
  time of the commencement of the eclipse drew
  near, the streets, in some of the quarters, were
  full of individuals braving a sunstroke or the
  wheels of the passing arabeahs in wild anxiety
  lest the moment of contact should pass
  unobserved. Many photographic records were
  taken, and the majority of those which we
  have seen have been highly successful, portraying
  the crescent-like appearance of the
  eclipsed sun with great accuracy.
</p>
<p>
  Those who knew. nothing of science, and
  merely regarded the sun as a provider of light
  and heat, and to whom the statement that the
  earth moves round the sun is as improbable
  as its contrary is unimportant, anticipated the
  event with a certain uneasiness. They had
  an idea that something was going to happen
  to “Eshshems,” they had been told that its
  disc would be almost entirely hidden from
  their view, and that day would become night,
  and believing all, they brooded uneasily over
  what would happen, and wondered what it
  would all look like.
</p>
<p>
  How disappointed they must have been
  Unable to appreciate that the sun, while completely
  hidden at Assouan, would be only
  partially obscured at Alexandria and other
  stations even closer to the zone of totality,
  they had hoped or feared that a great and
  solemn darkness would pass over the earth,
  attended by rare and curious portents.
</p>
<p>
  Bnt all they saw was a black something
  that came into contact with the rim of the
  sun’s disc and ate its way into the fiery circle,
  disposing like a glutton of more and more till,
  in the words of a spectator, “the sun looked
  like a huge cheese from which a great piece had
  been bitten.” Such was the eclipse to many
  of the smoked-glass enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>
  The morning opened hazily enough, but the
  sky cleared as the day grew older, and the
  conditions at the actual moment of the eclipse
  were as favorable as any observer could desire.
  We chose the <placeName> Ras el Tin lighthouse</placeName> as our
  point of observation, obtained admittance,
  thanks to the kind offices of Admiral Sir R.M.
  Blomfield, and began our climb. The extreme
  effort of climbing 261 steps to the summit,
  was right well repaid, and had there been no
  eclipse we should never have regretted it,
  for the view from the platform just below
  the light is the best in Alexandria. The
  coast from San Stefano to Fort Agami the
  grey town, the harbour with its shipping and
  quays and the Mariout Lake, white with salt
  incrustations west of the causeway, a dull
  greenish grey to the east, were all stretched
  below us, wonderfully clear and distinct despite
  the haze that drew in from seaward, and in
  the harbour below the white sails of the racing
  boats passed like swans.
</p>
<p>
  At the first moment of contact nothing—but
  a violent and painful glare—was visible to
  the naked eye, nor could the smoked glass
  show us anything, but being provided with a
  fairly strong telescope with smoked lenses, we
  were able to follow the progress of the moon’s
  shadow from start to finish. The first sign of
  the eclipse that we could discern was a
  peculiar jaggedness in the sun's circumference.
</p>
<p>
  This was noticeable shortly after 3 p.m.—
  the first contact taking place at 2 h. 59 min.
  41 sec. The shadow moved forward very
  slowly but by 3.30 p.m. a certain diminution
  in the sun’s light and heat was apparent, and
  the glasses showed that the circular edge of
  the moon had made considerable progress.
</p>
<p>
  The effect of the diminution of the sun’s
  light was first obvious shortly after 3.30 p.m,
  when the colours of the sea and shore, which
  had previously been warm and glowing, began
  to wane and, if the expression may be used,
  to fade. It was not that the actual colour of
  objects really changed, but that its intensity
  diminished.
</p>
<p>
  This feature increased with the progress of
  tbe eclipse, but it was not possible to distinguish
  any change of colour till shortly
  before 4 p.m., when the obscuration was nearing
  its maximum. The sea was then a dead
  slaty green in the harbour, a remarkably
  beautiful violet near the horizon, a dark
  blue green in the middle distance. The Mariout
  Lake had completely lost its colour, and
  objects on the shore seemed to be suffused
  with a slight shade of yellow. At the time
  of maximum obscuration, the sun had shrunk
  to a crescent which appeared to be a little
  larger than the new moon. No stars were
  visible, at least from our vantage point. The
  day was now decidedly dull, but not in the
  least dark; distant objects, though their colour
  had in some degree faded or altered, being
  just as distinguishable as at midday. In the
  town, owing to the abundance of shade from
  houses and the narrowness of many of the
  streets the effect was certainly more marked,
  but we imagine that many of the observers
  must have felt a certain disappointment at
  being able to dispense with articial light;
  indeed the strongest impression left on us
  was that of the immense power of the solar
  light even when reduced to 12% of its original
  volume.
</p>
<p>
  The recovery from the obscuration does not
  meric special description. The light returned
  very rapidly, and within half an hour from the
  moment of maximum obscuration everything
  had regained its normal appearance. One
  result of the eclipse which we noticed, was
  more durable, the later afternoon though as
  damp as it always is in the autumn months,
  being much cooler than usual.

  <head>AT CAIRO</head>
  <p>(From Our Own Correspondent)</p>
  <p>Cairo, Wednesday</p>
  <p>
    The early morning yesterday was as dull
    and cloudy in Cairo as it usually is at this
    period, but at about eight o’clock the
    atmosphere become quite clear and continued
    so for the rest of the day, which was
    fortunate for those anxious to have a good
    view of the phenomenon which, with one or
    two others subjects, has been the chief
    topic of conversation for the past week or
    two, not only amongst Europeans but also
    the educated portion of the native population
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the lowest classes of the latter the
    most extraordinary notions seemed to prevail
    as to the cause of the wonder that was about
    to happen and its conseqnenoes. Some of the
    more vigorous observers of religion uttered
    prayers all the while. In the purely native
    quarters, troops of children with a few adults
    as well perambulated the streets, beating tomtoms
    and invoking divine protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Cairo the eclipse was only partial but
    about nine-tenths of the sun’s disc was covered
    and this took place at thirteen minutes past
    four when the light became much dimmer,
    somewhat resembling a very bright moon-
    light evening or the shortened twilight of this
    time of the year. It commenced at four
    minutes past three and the eclipse ended at
    a quarter past five o’olook. These were the
    times famished by the Survey Department
    which, however, differed slightly from those
    given by the eminent astronomer, M. Buscaloni,
    and published by us last Friday. Most of
    the Europeans witnessed the phenomena from
    the house tops with smoked glasses, without
    which it was not possible, even when the
    eclipse was at its fullest to look at the sun
    with the naked eye with any comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Mahomedan writer of about a century
    back recounts that a total eclipse of the sun in
    his time excited veritable terror amongst the
    population of Cairo, many people being so
    alarmed as to hide themselves in barricaded
    rooms. He likewise relates that animals and
    birds seemed as susceptible as human beings,
    and doubtless had fear at the disappearance of
    the sun.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this year’s had been also a total eclipse
    many strange sights would have been witnessed
    in the metropolis amongst the illiterate native
    population. According to another writer plants
    and flowers were influenced by the phenomen a
    and the leaves of those plants that close at
    night did the same during an eclipse that
    ocurred in his day. Whether such be a fact or
    not it is for the astronomers of to-day to
    enlighten us.

<p>
  Very considerable interest has been taken
  in Port Said in the great event of to-day, and
  the question of the eclipse has been the chief
  topio of conversation with almost everyone.
  Telescopes of all sorts and sizes were hastily
  prepared with little pieces of smoked orcolonred
  glass, and on all hands, almost since the day
  broke, one could observe people gazing at the
  snn, as though they could not depend upon
  scientists to have fixed the time accurately.
  Even the Arab bootblack seems to have heard
  that somethiog.out of the common was abont
  to happen, and with a certain amount of
  doubt and apprehension looked upwards
  wondering, and expecting he knew not what.
</p>

<p>
  The day broke in anything bnt a reassnring
  manner. Banks of cloud and mist had gathered
  over the Bky, making the morning like an
  October one in England. This mist and damp
  in the air is hot surprising in a way and indi-
  rectly is nndontedly caused by the eolips e itself.
  The cause of tides, as is well known, is due to
  the joint attraction of the sun and moon, and
  when the two bodies aot in oonjunotion, as they
  do in a direct line daring an eclipse, the effeot
  is a much higher tide than nsnal. Anyone
  here, who has watohed the un behaviour
  lately, will have notioed how much higher the
  water has stood in the early evening, and this
  has caused a quite unwonted humidity and
  resultant mist for the last two mornings.
</p>

<p>
 I explain this point as I have heard several
 people during the last few days, propound deep
 theories on the weather changes which accompany eclipses.
 It was not the direct influence of the eclipse on the weather which
 caused the misty day, but the peculiar situation of lower Egypt,
 having so much semi-marshy land which covers and uncovers with the slightest
 tidal variation.
</p>

<p>
  Long before the critical hour of first contact
  approached (the time at which the moon’s disc
  touched the extreme edge of that of the sun)
  numbers of people could be seen watching
  for the sun’s appearanoe through their
  specially prepared shades and glasses. The
  hour, as published iu the “Gazette," of 3.13
  p.m. passed and few were aware of it,
  for without a good telescope fitted with
  suitable shades, and without the observer
  knowing exactly where to look, it is more
  than likely he would have seen nothing
  of the herald of this wonderful phenomena. I
  was perhaps a little more fortunate than many,
  having at my disposal a very good “Ross
  pancritic” glass properly fitted up, aided by
  which I easily saw and noted the first contact,
  which ocourred at 3h. 12m. 40sec. p.m.
</p>

<p>
  Nothing particular was to be noted during
  the first few minutes, except the gradual
  encroachment of the dark serrated-edged mass
  of the moon on the bright solar disc, but
  towards four o’clook, daylight had very sensibly
  diminished and terrestrial objects had begun
  to take on themselves the weird, lurid, half
  eleotric type of light which is so peculiarly characteristic
  of these eclipses. This strange colour
  which everything rapidly took as time moved
  onwards appeared to resemble nothing so much
  as the hue which objects have during the
  lightning flashes of a heavy thunderstorm, the
  daylight becoming less and less as moments
  sped on towards the hour of maximum eclipse.
  By 4.16 p.m.over 75 per cent of the sun’s light
  had been cut off.
</p>

<p>
  The calculated hour for Port Said of 4.26
  p.m., at which the maximum eclipse was to
  take place, seemed to pass without any special
  notice being taken of it by the layman, as, for
  some moments before, owing to the effects of
  irradiation, by virtue of which all bright
  objects to the naked eye appear much larger
  than they really are, the blank disc of the
  moon seemed to the naided eye to have
  almost ceased to move.
</p>

<p>
  The sun at 4.26 p.m, greatly resembled a
  very bright new moon, having in its arms an
  opaque disc suoh as is frequently seen at the
  period of perigee, when, oembined with suitable
  weather conditions, the new moon appears
  to hold the old one in its arms.
</p>

<p>
  In Port Said to-day there was no sign of the
  corona which waa eagerly looked for by many,
  and many people seemed disappointed that
  the day continned so light, but it was hardly
  surprising, when one considers that only 27
  minutes of arc were out off. Near the south-
  western edge, however, a faint extended
  phosphorescence could be seen, as I have stated.
  A planet for which I was on the look out,
  was to be seen to the south, and I fancied I
  could piok up another, Venus, close to the
  western horizon. but was not sure.
</p>

<p>
  Regulus, a star of the first magnitude, situated
  only a few degrees west of the two bodies,
  I could not piok up, nor did I see any of the
  numerous smaller ones which in totality
  should have been clearly visible,— and so passed
  the best of what we saw here of the eclipse.
</p>

<p>
  By 4.45 p.m. most people appeared to have
  got tired of watching, especially as every
  minute increased the size of the sun’s visible
  crescent, and the consequent brightness of
  daylight, and all seemed to think that nothing
  more was to be seen.
</p>

<p>
  The moment of last contact when the moon
  finally left the eastern edge of the sun,
  occured at the predicted time, 5.22 p.m. Then
  came the sunset, which, I have noticed, on the
  day of solar eclipses generally has a beauty all
  its own. The damp air here is peculiarly suited
  for these beautiful effects and as the glowing
  orb sunk in the west into a somewhat hazy
  horizon, the sky took on the same gloomy
  reds, yellows and dark blues extending to
  the eastern horizon.

<p>Suez, Wednesday</p>
<p>
  The conditions under which the eclipse of
  the sun was viewed from this station were
  exceedingly favorable. The sky was perfectly
  clear and not a cloud was to be seen, and
  though there was a slight haze it did not
  interfere in any way with the observations
  taken here.
</p>
<p>
  It is safe to say that the eclipse was viewed
  by everybody in Suez, smoked glasses were
  everywhere in evidence, and an altogether
  remarkable interest was taken in the phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
  The shadow of the moon was first observed
  in contact with the sun at eight minutes past
  three by Cairo time or eight minutes past one
  by Greenwich time, and it disappeared at
  thirteen minutes past five by Cairo time. The
  direction waa S. S. E. 81° west.
</p>

<p>
  At no time did darkness reech any great
  degree, but as the sun became gradually more
  and more hidden the temperature grew appreciably
  cooler, and a curious effect, of which I
  have never seen the parallel, was observable.
  The light became much less intense and
  resembled neither night nor day, objects
  assumed a peculiar outline, and the colour, or
  colors, I should say, of the sea were indescribable.
</p>

<p>
  The horizon was particularly noticeable. As
  the solar disc gradually disappeared from view,
  a haziness appeared, and the outline, which
  during most of the day had been well-defined,
  was first of all blurred, and it then became
  difficult to distinguish, and at the same time
  assumed a greyish-blue tint.
</p>

<p>
  There was, however, at the place where the
  rays from the unobscured portion of the sun
  lit upon the sea, a bright light, in strange
  contrast to its surroundings, and of an almost
  silver hue, which gave an excellent effect.
</p>

<p>
  In the town itself, I am told, an almost better
  effect was obtained than in the open space
  from which I observed the eclipse, for here there
  was a greater degree of darkness, which from
  a popular point of view, is the greatest feature,
  of such a phenomenon, be it total, or be it
  partial, and no little oonsternation was apparent
  amongst some of the more youthful observers,
  who were unable to understand such a strange
  occurrence in broad daylight.
</p>

<p>
  The astronomists who witnessed the eclipse
  from here were all amateurs, so that one cannot
  hope for an authentic aooount of the phenomena
  presented, but the eclipse did not reach a
  sufficient degree of totality to render them
  worthy of a special reoord. It has, however,
  been an event of great interest to amateur
  astronomers and physicists, and many of
  these, who were unable to go to that zone
  where their enthusiasm would have met with
  more valuable results, will have interesting
  records of the great event of 1905 as seen at
  Suez.

  The total solar eclipse began here yesterday
  afternoon at forty minutes past three. Totality,
  which was reached at twenty-two minutes past
  four, lasted for the space of sixty-eight seconds.
  The eclipse ended at forty five minutes past
  five. Numerous observers watched the phenomenon
  from here and special magnetic observations
  were taken from the roof of the great
  temple here. The results showed that no
  special magnetic disturbances took place during

<head>THE TRACK OF THE SHADOW</head>
<P>
  The shadow of the moon, a vast circular
  patch, covering an area of some 1,700 square
  miles (a little larger than Switzerland), that is
  to say abont 130 miles in diameter, first struck
  the earth at sunrise somewhere near Winnipeg
  in Canada, and just skirting the southern
  shores of Hudson Bay its centre reached the
  Atlantic on the coast of Labrador, near Domino
  Harbour. Traversing the ocean it first
  touched the European Continent on the north
  coast of Spain near Luarca, and passing in a
  south-easterly direction through Burgos and
  Ateca, reached the Mediterranean at Oropesa;
  and, involving the Balearic Islands
  in its gloom, it reached the African coast
  near Philippeville in Algeria. Passing across
  the north-east corner of Tunis it again
  crossed the sea at Sfax, and skirting the
  African coast between Tripoli and the Gulf of
  Sidra traversed a portion of the Libyan
  Desert, passing across Egypt, Assouan being
  near the centre line; and crossing the Red
  Sea abont the middle of its length passed
  into Arabia, where it died away near the coast
  of the Indian Ocean, where it set eclipsed.

  It is five years and a quarter since a total
  eclipse of the sun could be observed within such
  easy reach of the capitals of Europe and America,
  and in that interval the progress of physical
  science, as well as the perfection of instruments
  connected therewith, have made great strides,
  and, while the diseovery of radium and the investigations
  of its allied radio-active substances
  have opened up altogether new fields of research
  in physical chemistry, the rapid advances
  which have been made during recent years
  in the electrical theory of matter, together with
  the greatly extended application of the spectroscope
  to solar and stellar physics, all bid
  fair to confer on this eclipse an unprecedented
  value for its possible results.

<head>SHADOW BANDS.</head>
<p>
  There is an interesting and hitherto Unexplained
  phenomenon which is often seen during
  a solar eclipse for a few seconds just before
  and just after totality, and that is the appearance
  of what are called "shadow bands" passing
  as waves of shadow with greater or less rapidity
  across the ground or on the fronts of walls
  facing the sun. Although there is, perhaps, no
  great scientific value to be anticipated from their
  investigation, their very mysteriousness is a sufficient
  reason for their careful observation, and at
  every station at which observers are stationed
  they have been noted, and the following
  particulars recorded; the direction in
  which the bands lie, the direction in which
  they move, the velocity with which they travel,
  the width of the bands, and of the spaces
  between them. The object of this investigation
  an attempt to ascertain if they be
  due to the effect of our atmosphere, or to
  anything connected with the sun itself.
  That they are not optical illusions is proved
  by the fact that they are nearly always
  seen by several observers and have been
  photographed. It is possible they may be a
  phenomenon of diffraction and interference
  occurring at a time when what is still left of the
  photosphere is becoming a mere point of
  light in the sky, but in either case their
  motion is, at present, impossible to explain.
  We are not aware of the appearanoe of any
  of these bands during tbe eclipse of yesterday,
  but it is quite possible that later news from
  our special correspondent at Assouan may
  bear reference to them.

              FROM “THE EGYPTIAM GAZETTE
of May 17, 1882.
THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.
“The total eclipse of the sun, which took
place this morning and was also visible in
Europe, began at Greenwich at 6 h. 10 m. this
morning ; the beginning of the total phase was
«t 6 h. 46 m. and the end of this phase was
at 7 h. 23 m. The magnitude of the eclipse
(at Greenwich) was 0.245. From the first to
the last contact with the shadow 5 h. 28 m. G'
elapsed, the first contact taking place at 5 h.
1 m. 2' and the last at 10 h. 29 m. 8' morn.
This day may, therefore, be said to have begun
only at about half past ten this morning, which
will certainly have causecbsome excitement in
many of the vUlpfges of the interior.
In many plaices the ignorant will have
thought that the eclipse was a presage ol‘
the beginning of the end. But they will have
speedily recognized that the darkness which
accompanies the maximum of such a pheno-
menon was not even total. The only difference
observable was the fact that objects took a
greenish or copper tint, producing a strange
effect, and which surprises every one who
has not witnessed this effect on some previous
occasion.
Arago writes as fbllQwsj^specting the tota
eclipse of thtf 8th Julj*1842,\riiich he observer
from Perpignan, and which surprised many of
inhabitants of that town :—
♦“The hour for the commencement of the
eclipse approached. Nearly twenty thousand
persons examined, through smoked glass, the
radiant sun on its azure field. Till then,
a legitimate curiosity had inspired the spec-
tators ; but, when the sun, reduced to & narrow
strip, only threw a feeble light on the horizon,
an unquiet feeling appeared to agitate every
person ; all appeared to wish to communicate
their impressions to those standing aroync
them.
“Then there was a rumbling noise similar to
that of a distant sea after a storm. This noise
grew louder and louder as the solar strip
became gradually less; the strip disappeared ;
finally darkness suddenly succeeded to the light,
and a profound siienee marked this .phase or
the eclipse, just as clearly as had been done
by the pendulum of our astronomical clock.
“The phenomenon, in all its magnificence,
triumphed over the petulancy of youth, over
the light-headedness whioh is affected by a
certain class of men as a sign of superiority,
over the noisy idifference customary among
soldiers. A profound silence reigned every-
where, even the birds had ceased to sing.
“After a solemn pause of about two minutes
transports of joy, loud shouts saluted, with
the same accord, the same spontaneity, the
reappearance of the sun’s rays.”
We may add to this account of the illustrious
savant that the animals also show their
surprise by well understood movements, and
even the vegetable creation is subject to the
influence of this phenomenon.
Eclipses of the sun occur whenever the moon
passes before the sun, and eclipses of the
moon whenever that luminary enters the
shadow which the eather throws behind it.
F^)ip«AH of the sun occur at new moon and'
eclipses of the moon are. only seen when it is >
at its full. Only seven eclipses can take place
in any one year and never less than two;
in the latter case they are always eclipses qfi
the sun. In every period of twenty eight
jmji»and, ten;days, there, are,, as a,mean,
twenty eight central eclipses, that are suscep-
tible of becoming annular or total according to
oiroumstances; but as the terrestrial zone along
which the phenomenon can be observed, either
in one phase or the other, is very narrow,
total or partial eclipses are extremely rare
occurrences. At -Greenwich only one total
eclipse was observable during the eighteenth
oentury, and this will be the last one visible i
there till next century.”
SOME MEDIEVAL AND
fWSES.
MODERN
SUN SPOTS AND THE CORONA.
It is an interesting fact, and one fraught
with great possibilities, that between the
eclipse of'1900 and that of 1905, both of
which making so similar a|J .track over the
European Continent^ Jhere is, in one import-
ant respect, a great difference. While the 1900
eclipse, which was so well observed in Spain
and Algeria, was at a period of sunspot mini-
mum, this eclipse comes when sunspots are
near their maximum. And as there is very
little doubt that there is a close connection
between the nature and form of the corona and
the prevalence of sunspots, it may be hoped
. that among the many observations have been
made on the corona and from stations s6
far distant from one another as Labrador and
Egypt, connected by a chain of observing
stations between, new light may-be thrown of
the nature of sunspots and on their connection
with the great coronal envelope of the, sun.
That there is an undoubted connection be-
tween sunspots and this earth is now well
established, and their influence upon,earth
currents and magnetio storms, by which telei-
graphy is so often retarded, has parted front
the region of coincidence to take its place in
that of cause and effect; and when it is consid-
ered how vast retire area of the solar atmos-
phere which is occupied by a large spot, some
of them being 150,000 miles across, and that
they indicate gigantic activity in the envelop,
ing atmosphere of the sun the wonder fe rather
that their influence upon the earth is not
greater than.it appears to be. There are among
astronomers and physicists very diverse opil
tutm es to the ireton and origin of these great
fidUs ef activity W the sun,'and it may be
Imped that the observations made yesterday
prey threw considerable light upon the yiestioa.
A variety of iterating allusions to tl.fe
occurrence of tfta| eefipses of the sun gre to
found iirthymnSals medwevel and modem
history.
Halley wrote a paper on the total solar
eclipse whioh occurred in LondoiMp^th^pear
1715, and mentions, in i 11 astratieira.efj.tlie
rarity of such phenomena, that no previous
eclipse of the same nature had been visible in
the rfnptrepolis,, since ifee gye*r. 1140. \ The
ffma^rtarfpsasawreradtf in that Mk4aJTOirq~
nicle” and short mention is made of it by'
William of Malmesbury. The “Saxon Chroni-
cle” states that “in the Lent the sun and the
day. dafken®d about the noontide of the day,
i-wheifimen warm eating, and they- did ^ight
their -"candles toeat by. That waadheHhif-
teenth day before the Calends of April Men
were very much struck with wonder.” William
of Malmesbury in mentioning the subject
in papers which he wrote says “that while
persons werf^re si^igiSl th^mejlsSfe J
darkness became so grtot' thatTThey “ftefed
the ancient chaos was about to return ; and
upon going out immediately they perceived
several stars about the sun.”
History mentions total eclipses of the sun
as having occurred in the years 1107, 1241,
1415, 1433, 1485, 1506, 1530, 1544, 1560,
1567, 1590, 1605, 1652, and fi1699. ’ The
eclipses of 1433, and 1598, and 1652 Were
viable in the British Isles, the first of-these
occurring in Scotland. According to Maolanrin
there is a manuscript account of the T433
eclipse preserved in the library of the Edin-
burgh university. The moon’s shadow on the
occasion of theeclipse of >1578 appears to have
passed'over the border, counties of England
and Scotland^ - and the day of its occurrence
which was a Saturday, was long known as
“Black Saturday.” The eclipse of 1652 was
visible in the North of,.: Ireland,] and in
Scotland.
In 1706 there occurred a total eclipse gf.
the sun which was visible in the southern
countries of Europe. At Montpelier, i where i t
was observed by Plantade and Capfes, the
total obscuration laster four minutes and ten
seconds. During this time the dark body of
moon appeared to be surrounded by a corona
of polar light The planets Venus, Mercury,
and Saturn, and several of the fixed stare were
visible to the naked eye. On the summits of
some ofithe mountains of Switzerland, where
the view was not impeded by the gross vapours
whioh accumulate in / the lower regions of the
atmosphere, the stare appeared as thiokly,
strewed as in the time of full moon.
On the 3rd May 1715 there ooourred a total

SOLAR ECLIPSES OF ANCIENT DAY$.
- i '	, 1
The- ancient literature of Greece and Rotde
contains several incidental allusions to tlite
occurrence of total eclipses of the sun. The
most celebrated of these is- the eclipse men-
tioned by -Herodotus as -having taken place
during a battle between the Modes and fife
Lydians. The story , relates ■ how- that the twp
hostile armies, were so terrified by-, the spec-
tacle of the eclipse;: , that they suddenly de-
sisted from fighting,, and eoeelnded a treated
of amity and peace. He further states that
the eclipse had been foretold to the doniaiM
by Thales , the Milesian. The .precise date ot
this eclipse has given rise to modkdtecusBion
fe, modern times. In , 1811 - the late-Francis
Baily cemmunioated a., paper to the^Royal
Society, in itwhich, by, ,availing himself-df

Hansen. The Donolusion .at .whiehJierMQvbi
is that the eclipse referred toby Herodotus
must have occurred on the 17th. (Scptefefeer|
585 B.C. „He . shows that this date.neootd*

the time of Aarathooles, and also with ad

is that the, eclipse referred toby Herodotus
must have occurred on tire 7 to , September;
585 B.C. .,He shows that this date, neoonis
satisfactorily with the eclipse recorded diwi
fee. time of Ag*4hoole8, and also with ad
eclipse briefly alluded to by., Xepophon, yfed
records it. as having ooourred at Larissa, id
Asia, during tire retreat of the ton thousand
j reeks along the .Tigris over fee high, table*
lands of Armenia to Trebitond (Trapezus) on
the Black Sea (400 B.C.).
Plutarch also makea jefewnoe to a total
eclipse of. the sun whioh , - ooouraed fe his
time. The aooount of^this is given in- his
“Dissertation-on the LunarRpots” and though
the allusion is brief, it is nevertheless fair
teresting. He says that it ooouned about
midday, that the darkness was so great M
to oause the day to rasetoble night, and feat
stars were visible all over the firmamtat.
Kepler; who investigated the probable time
of the ooourrence of this eclipse, is of opinion
that it is identical with one which took plies
n the year USA. D,

raftxtragdinary interest was aroused in Slain
byrfhe efiipse, and special preparations were
jupe foRobserving it A number of scientific
OTpeditions, both private and official erected
provisional observatories fe the eclipse zone and
the Spanish army was represented, several
to study the eclipse from the higher and more
rarefied strata of the atmosphere. The import-
ance of these observations, taken at heights
far above the clouds, must be very great and
to enable the reoords to be as extensive as pos-
sible numerous small balloons carrying not
men, but photographic apparatus specially pre-
pared to receive and preprv^ impressions at

oreectr-To minimise • theT'-risk of losing any
reoords special instructions were issued to the
people and to the local authorities to secure
and guard these balloons on their fall.
King Alfonso XIII and the Royal family
went to Soria to observe the eclipse, and Mad-
rid society followed their example, the summer
visitors toMoncayo, and other well known
health resorts fe northern Spain,showing great
eagerness to be present at the chief points of
observation on toe great day. N umerous foreign

              from ihe United _ §ing4om during the year

              1896 with the sole object of .assisting British
              trade in this country. The services of the
              Chamber are always at the disposal of any
              member desiring information on trade matters
              generally, including the question of appoint-
              ing suitable agents. As no fee is oharged for
              such advice, it is obviously in the interests of
              all British traders here to beoome members,
              especially when it is remembered that the
              annual subscription is merely the nominal one

              ACTPALITE
              Le Kraoh Oronier
              La situation de la Sooiiti des Sacraries s‘
              Raftinerie, qni embrasse k elle seule toute l’in
              dustrie suoriire igyptieone, prisente pour le
              pays, on le oomprendra faoilement, nn intirit
              vital. Toute la produotion de oanne k sucre do
              l’Egypte itant aohetie par la Sooiiti, si oelle-
              ci venait k disparaltre, le pays perdrait an-
              nuellement plusieurs millions sans compter
              qu’une telle ohute entralnerait la mine com
              plite de plnsieurs locality de la Haute-Egypte.
              Bien qu’on ne sache pas encore si la Sooiiti
              des sucreries Egyptiennes a une part dans lei
              perte3 du syndicat Cronier, nous voyons lea
              cours des actions de oette sooiiti tomber a
              Paris k fr. 45 pour remonter a fr. 49 en cloture.
              Heureusament pour les aotionnaires, l’itenduo
              du mal ne se mesure pas k la baisse qui s’est
              produite, baisse qui a iti provoqaie soit par
              la panique des ditenteurs d’aotions, soit par
              les executions forccea pour le oompte des ban-
              ques qui sont k dioouvert et par l’absenoe de
              la contre-partie dans l’aohat des titres jetis
              sur le marohi. Personne k Paris n’ose aoheter
              un titre d’une socidti, sur le compte de laquelle
              on Bait fort pen de chose, surtont apr&s une
              faillite aussi effroyable que celle de Cronier.
              II font ajouter a toutes ces raisons la mise
              en vente prochaine du stock considerable d’ac-
              tions appartenant k Cronier et anx membres
              de la famille Say qui sont les prinoipaux ac-
              tionnaires de la Sooiiti.
              La dibhole une fois passee, le titre rebondira
              a sa veritable valeur, oar, si mal il y a, il n’y a
              pas apparence qu’il soit de nature k entralner
              la faillite de la Sooiete. Le President ne pou-
              vait, si mime il l’eftt voulu, miner d’un oonp
              nne societe pareille. Les detoumements de
              fonds sont teparables. Quant k avoir engage
              ontre mesure la societe, il ne faut pas oublier
              que leu^Sucreries et Raffinerie ont leur siege
              an Cairo et que les differences de jeu, pour etre
              opposables k une societe egyptienne, doivent
              fitre sanotionnees par la justice du pays.
              Or, danB le cas qui nouB oooupe, l’exoeption de
              jeu trouve pleinement son application. Il y a
              deplus des administrateurs qui oht outre-
              passe '«urs pouvoirs et qui ne sauraient en
              aucune fa^on engager la Sooiete des sucreries
              d’Egypte. Il est oonsolant pour les aotionnaires
              de voir qu’il y a dans le oonseil d’administra-
              tion des gens presentaut de la surfaoe et
              conacients de leur propre responsabilite, nous
              vonlons dire M. Barois, administrates des
              ohemins de fer egyptiens, MM. Arbib et Ther-
              nynck; ainsi que M. Dorizon, le Direoteur de la
              Societe Generate, un des plus puissants ita-
              blissements de banque de France.
              Pour calmer les esprits, il est necessaire
              que les administrateurs du Caire s’expliquent
              et publient un bilan k oe jour le plus tdt pos-
              sible. C’est lk un devoir auquel ils ne sauraient
              se derober, oar les aotionnaires peuvent, en
              vertu du droit oommun, provoquer de telles
              declarations par voie de Justice. On doit faire
              le jour le plus oomplet et dire aux aotionnaires
              oe qu’il en est de la Sooiete et de son aotif. Un
              oommunique officiel seul pourra moderer la
              surexoitation k laquelle sont en proie les Bour-
              ses de Paris et d’Egypte.

  TH1 EGYPTIAN GAZETTE, THURSDAY, AUGUST 31, 1905.
7 ,
A MOUNTAIN PARADISE.
There is nothing to do in the Canary Is-
lauds, and one has no energy to do it with.
The climate is lovely, no donbt, for the snn
bhines, and the daily range of temperature
even in February is no more than 65 to 70
degrees, bnt only necessity can make a man
energetic. What supplied me with the ne-
cessary strength of mind and body to tackle
the Peak was the simple fact that I had told
frieLds of mine in England that I meant to do
it Otherwise I should have sat in a chair to
look at it, or have ascended it by telescope in
the same way that Mark Twain did Mont
Elanc. But having said I was going to do it
hampered me.
On the evening of my arrival at Orotava I
asked for guides, and heard that those usually
supplied by my hotel were away. I sent tor
one Frederico, not upon the list, and he came
headlong from the Villa, and brought his
brother Dionisio. I was especially striot
in ordering a sound mule, one whioh was
“sano” and had no sore upon it Frederico
and Dionisio swore by their gods and all the
saints that they possessed the soundest and
most wonderful mule in all the islands, an
animal which knew the way to the Peak by
himself and would carry me there as if I sat
in an armchair. For one rides to Alta Vista,
where the hut stands at the height of 10,700
feet. As to being carried to that height as if
in a chair or a hammock I had my doubts,
for I knew mules, and my notions on that
r^Bead were not far out. Moreno, for that was
my mule’s name, indeed proved sound. I
took his saddle off to see, for in these matters
no inhabitant of the island is to be trusted,
and he possessed all his skin, whioh is a rare
thing in the Canaries.
So we started at seven in the morning,
Dionisio and I and a man called Teleforo, for
Fredeiico had other work. I had made my
arrangements as to payment, and on telling
them .that if I was satisfied I should add
another dollar or five pesetas to the agreed
sum, they swore I was a very noble Caballero,
and one of the moBt generous people they had
ever had the luck to meet. This oheered me
up, and we rode to the Villa Orotava in great
spirits, there picking up a pack mule, named
after the great Spanish painter, Murillo, which
carried the forage and the men’s food and my
food and blankets. The Villa is a half-desert-
ed, quiet town rather more than a thousand
feet above Orotava Puerto ; it has the same air
of exclusiveness that any half-ruined old aristo-
crat might possess. Its quiet is the quiet of
poverty. And yet it is very beautifnl. An
hour after leaving the town we passed out of
the area of cultivation and left the little hill
farms, ooming to thin forest and a flowering
shrub called oodeso.
Aftet the little forests and the codeso we
came to cinders. For, after all, the Canary
Islands are only seven cinders heaps, the
product of .fire. A handful of soil is always
half cinders. The path grew steep and the
mules slid and floundered, and the Villa faded
below us, and the port shone in sunshine on
the verge of the sea. And the sea horizon
spread further and further and yet appeared
to rise till it seemed that we were in a deep
cup. The illusion iB difficult to rid one’s self
of. And then at last we lost the sea for a
time and came to a scene of fiery deflation ;
burnt rocks, oinder heaps, a split or canyon,
or barranco, called the Barranco de la Reina.
Here the retama begins, for on the upward
lands of pumice and cinder, nothing can grow
but this. It is a strong and vigorous hard-
wood shrub that grows in patches, and it is
sometimes ten feet high. The foliage is like
mare’s tail; it is tough and acrid, and the
mules seemed to love it We were olose to the
Pertillo or gate to the Canyadas, by whioh one
means the ancient and vast crater in whioh
the Peak as we know it now riees. For the old
crater must have been ore mighty lake of
fire ten miles across, not perhaps all a flame
of lava at once but like Eilauea in the Sand-
. which Island, an ebbing and flowing sea of
fire. The walls of this crater are partially
swept away, but even now they stand hundreds
of feet high for long miles, and are huge but-
tresses scarped and scraped by the heat of
centuries. Ard in places water has washed
them away. For sometimes the volcano has
vomited floods. Ia other parts towards the
north-west these barriers are beaten as low as
they are at the Portillo. But towards Vilaflor
they stand red, gigantic, and fire-eaten relios
of a dreadful past.
How does the retama grow so green on
cinders and pumice 1 For these strange Canya-
das are a great plain of pumice, beaten and
pounded into little fragments and to powder.
The whole plain is brown and white, the
powdered ropilli move with the wind, move of
themselves it seems. For the dead branches of
still rooted retama seem to flow down hill on
a faint slope from their parent roots. The air
was fine and still as we rode over the plain
It reminded me of the air of the highest
plateaus of Texas. It was keen, intoxioating,
bright. I forgot that I had no energy in
Orotava. The air of the C mya-^as seemed life
itself
And far across the brown plain, which look-
ed less barren than it was, for the oolonr
recalled the burnt and brown grasses of
Australia, the Peak rose, the Peak of Teneriffe.
El Pico de Teide, the ancient home of the
Guancbe gods. It was even yet five thousand
feet above us, but it showed itself as a bold
homp, a gigantic fnmarole shaped like a
rounded breast with another oinder heap upon
its snmmit like a nipple. It was very old, very
Strange, very grim, unlike any other monntain
that I bad seen. It possessed none of the
terrors of the icy peaks of the Alps, and yet
•new gleamed upon it still. But it had a
character all its iwn. If was my first vcloanio
fountain,	'fl
To the■ left as we went south-west Monte
Bianco ro'e in another low hump, a mountain
of white pumioe. Here and there juts of
volcanic rock protruded from the earth of ash,
like decayed tusks. Each tusk had once been a
fire jet. Now we passed bits of pumice, where
a pumice mine had been, and Moreno plough-
ed through it almost as deeply as if it had
been snow. Far above us on the slopes leading
to the Peak itself were huge separate blocks of
lava, which had rolled from a great lava dike
as ice breaks from an ioofall. They shone afar
off, gleaming in the sun, polished, clean
fractured like obsidian. And the great walls
or dikes of lava seemed ytt to roll down from
the crater. They showed black, tremendous
and barren. It is only in the lower (run try
that the poisonous euphorbia grows on lava.
Now we were even leaving the hardy retama
behind us as we climbed upward to the old
oamping grounds where people used to sleep
before the high hut of Alta Vista was built.
The first camp was called Estancia de los
Alemanos, and above it was the second one.
Estoncia de los Ingleses at nearly ten thousand
feet. And now the worn rough path over lava
and oinder and loose rapilli zigzagged up the
steep side of the great cone. For hours I had
seen no vegetation, no sign of life, not even a
vulture flew overhead, not so much as a strayed
moth ; the world was a glare of sand cinders,
fine rapilli, white pumice, black lava.
On either hand as we criss-orossed up the
steep slope a mighty dike of lava, broken,
oraokled like a spoilt glazed pot iu the fire,
shone in the sun which now began to leave us
in shadow. In another hour we came to a
little flat space, and were at Alta Vista, the
hut. It was four o’clook, and I looked down
upon a dead world of fire, and yet up to the
horizon. For the sea-line climbed high, we were
in a well. The distances in spite of the clear
air seemed immense. The vast opposing wall of
the Canyapas was red bastionod, and grim,
and as the sun began to get lower it grow pink
and wonderful. The brown stretches of the
Canyadas themselves were a floor of yellowish
fire. And still the effect was not so desolate as
it might have been, for here and there a
greenish mineral looked almost like grass, and
the brown was the exact brown of bnmt herb
age. But with the one exception of that faiht
rare tinge of green, the whole chord of oolonr
was at first in the oohres.
While the men unloaded the paok mule T
sat on the doorstep of the hut and stared east-
ward. Grand Canary wa9 not visible. It lay
under clouds, even as a huge departing steamer
might have been hidden under fresh smoke in
a following wind. I felt well. The fattgne of
riding was on me but I felt no touch of
mountain sickness. I sighed a little now and
again, but oould smoke. So far the rise from
the sea level to 10,700ft. had not affeoted my
heart. My mind too, went easily. I was pleased
to be at Alto Vista, above the world, in anoient
peace and quiet.
The wind was still. I looked down upon a
red moonscape, as it seemed to me. And as
one sees the shadows of the peaks in the moon,
so now the shadows of the peak and the lesser
fumaroles orept across the floor of the Canya-
das. Near me was a patch of snow, over it was
l>laok forbidding lava down below red faded to
grey and darkened. The shadow of the great
oone orept aoross the floor. But above me the
real moon was gibbons and faint. The calm air
froze. The shadow of the Peak became a vast
pyramid, outline! on the red-brown floor. It
orept to the ancient crater oliff, ciimbed it and
went seaward.
In half an hour the point of the shadow
was nearly to the horizon. The darkest umbral
point of the shadow was near the top. It look-
ed like a floating cloud ; triangular, vagne ; a
shadow on the air. Overhead the sky was
yellow and yellow-blue. The horizon was rosy,
and the oroter walls rosier still. The cliffs to-
wards Vilaflor shone wonderfally. And then
the shadow of the Peak shot beyond the hori-
zon. The Canyadas were covered with a thin
<rey haze. They looked as if they had been a
sea. There was a line of whitened pumice
and grey sand beneath the crater walls, look-
ing like an anoient beach. As the sun set
the effect was very beautiful. The shadow of
the oone was visible in the very air.. The
Grand Canary clouds were grey, purple, and
fine faint gold.
I had my supper alone in the paper-strewn
fiat. Dionisio and Teleforo prepared their
simple meal of gofio and potatoes, and were
lelighted to share my better food. But delioaoy
forbade them coming to my room. 1 lighted six
i&ndles, and had the stove red with dried
retama. Even so the cold was intense. Though
1 was warmly olad I took my rug and, with
n knife, cut a hole in the middle of it. and
converting it into a poncho, put my head
through the hole. After food I came ont on
the plateau, and found the moon brighter,
Under its rays the snow patohes looked in-
finitely cold and the black lava blaoker still.
The air was qniefi the frost intense.
Thrice that night I rose to light the fire
again. And my two men slept in their room
with a fire on the floor. The smoke came
through the cracks of the wall, and nearly
choked me. I slept, and froze, and woke, and
cnrsed all monntain-olimbing, and remembered
that in Orotava I should have been sleeping
with open windows. I woke finally at dawn,
vnd got my breakfast in a rage. Onoe more (as
always) I determined to climb no more monn-
ains. And then Dionisio said he was ready if
1 was. We started on the last fifteen hundred
feet just as the son rose, and the bard colours
>f the morning illumined the oold world.
The wind was bitter. I never felt snoh oold.
tad we passed much snow. The rough path
was blocked with it, and Dionisio evidently
had all a Southerner’s dislike of it. I found my
ice-axe useful a dozen times. Certainly I need-
ed it even si a stick, for my breath grew mise-
rably short. Every fifty feet I had to rest, And
at last we oame to the Rambleta, another
plateau, onoe a orater from whioh the final ash
oone now springs. It was at a slope of a IP tie
over SO deg., and the ashes were soft. I was
glad to see a patch of snow even if I had to
cut stops B it sooner than go upon the snow
Dionisio went half a mile round, while I cut
my way up it Blowly. At the steep top of the
snow I was nttoriy exhanatc!, aod sat down
for ten minutes.
The top was yet infinitely far away. I felt
weak, frozen, my heart was feeble. It was
obvious that the easy Peak was not so easy to
a man out of condition, to an invalid. But I
threw off my poncho, left it on the ashes, and
climbed again. We oame to the first blow-hole,
and at the sight of the smoke I cheered up.
When I came to El Nariz as it is called, I
knelt down and warmed my hands. But still
the top w is hundreds of feet above us. The
ast pull was ihe worst of all, for now the wind
from the south-west, the Counter Equatorial
current, blew fiercely. When I topped the edge
o( the high crater I was glad to fall flat behind
a rock and lie there to get my breath. And I
smelt sulphur and sulphurous aoid, and chok-
ing fumes of it came at me in gusts, whioh
finally drove me right to the windward side,
which was the last and final snmmit of the
peak.
There are days when one sees the whole
world, so to speak, from the rocks above the
sulphur pit. A man may count Teneriffe’s
satellites, Grand Canary, Fuertaventura, Lan-
zarote to the east; Palma, Gomera, and Hierro
to the v e-t. There islands swim in luoid sea
and air; are painted in fine atmosphere on the
climbing wall of the high sea horizon.But such
good fortune was not mine. The eastern islands
were under clouds an ! haze. And to the west
there was a mighty sea of cloud under whioh
Palma and her neighbours lay like rocks be-
neath snow. Yet suddenly the oloud-blanket
swayed and sank lower to the west; the heights
of Palma broke through ; and then Gomera
showed darkly, and, beyond it, to the south-
west, Hierro.Then the olouds olosed again, and
there was nothing visible but the slopes of my
own peak and the Canyadas, for even lower
Tenerffi itse’f was under olouds six thousand
feet above the sea level. The whole world as I
saw it was Volcano.
The looso-lipped, gaping orater of Chahorro
was beneath me to the west. It is dead, they
say, yet it looked but asleep. Further aoross
the Canyadas and beyond them rose other
volcanos, great fumaroles visibly aotive, smok-
ing heavily, like a steamer firing up with
Newavt'o coal. Two smoked furiously ; one
puffed i t leisure over against Garaohioo, onoe
a great port bat destroyed by lava in 1706.
As for me, I felt as if I was being destroyed by
frost, and crawled down into the orater, when
I had recovered my breath, to get warm at
sulphur vents ; the oreater was white and
yellow, cracked and beamed. Out of cracks
visible vapour oame, but here and there an
invisible gas nearly choked me. But the whole
pit or fiery saucer was warm and comfortable;
I left it with reluctanoe, for still the wind
carried ioe in it, and bit and nipped me. I
climbed once again tothe highestrock and took
in the volcanic world of ash, prized off the
actual top of tiie peak with the pick of my ice-
axe and put it in my pocket, and then turned
to go back. We ran and slid to the Rambleta,
one might almost have glissaded on the steep
ash. Bat as I descended I grew more tired ;
the oold got hold of me again. By the time I
reached the hut,I was done for, and lay on a
mattress, glad to get a medicinal drink of
brandy touched up with some drops of nux
vomica. My heart almost refused to beat, and
I came to the conclusion as I lay unable to
move for over an hour that climbing even easy
mountains over 12,000 feet was not a proper
amusement for an invalid. I thought so even
when I reached Orotava again that afternoon,
after seven hours on a mule, having descended
from the Peak by way of La Fortaleza, lood el
Alto and the steep desoent over Realejo. But
I am glad I went all the same, for there are
many mountains and only one Pioo de Teide.

WHORTLEBERRIES ON EXMOOR
“ Hurray ! Hnrray 7”
They all oame running ont of the village
school, shouting, whooping the boys snatch-
ing off and throwing np each other’s caps.
"Hprra-a-ay!” In more exuberance of joy,
olose by the churchyard steps, "girt” Jaok
Bawdon shoved little Tommy Steer np against
Priscilla Baker, a’mott fit to knook her down
“/ n’ you’d best to look out then to what yon
be about, John Bawdon. Girt bittle-head !"
cried Priscilla with sndden anger and a fine
accession of dignity. Bat there was no time
to quarrel on that sunny summer afternoon.
For .the whortleberries—"warte” they called
them, and even “harts”—were taming purple-
ripe upon the moot, and the holidays had
begun. Those summer holidays, that began
upon no fixed date, bnt were a movable
festival, changing according to the season, so
that the children might gather the wild
harvest of the moorland. There were little
more than a score, though they made noise
enough for a hundred as they ran down the
village street "Hoor-a-ay 1 "
1 have an affection for that Exmoor village
street It is so far-away, so quaint and old-
world.	j
It rnns along the hill-side, with little by-
ways up the incline, so that the houses Btand
one behind and above the other. Bnt the
sqnat embattled tower of the old grey church
rears higher than them all Before each cot-
tage is a slanting garden. Ranks of peas and
tall soarlet runners, laden now with flowers, as
well as beans ready for use, ran parallel with
the path of flat stones from the front door to
the hatoh. There are tall hoDy-hooks, groups
of blue monks’-hood, and here and there a
fnohsia bash, bearing tiny red flowers less than
an inoh in length. All sorts of creepers olam-
ber over the white-washed front, and geraniams
blind the downstair windows. There is a
clothesline, too, from which household olonts
and wonderful unmentionable garments flatter
gaily in the wind. A faggot pile and a dark
brown stack of turves stand olose by. The
smoke that rises curling ont of the ohimney is
bine and has no smuts.
Down the valley, merrily humming aronnd
rooks and boulders, leaps the Bilver Barle ;
and above the woods and enclosed fields that
skirt its oourse, both before and behind the
village, lies the broad moor where the whortle-
berries grow.
It is quite a little industry this pioking of
"wurts,” though it lasts only about three
weeks. No other fruit possesses so unexpected
a flavour. None gives so fine a blend with the
scald-cream, which is one of the most admir-
able institutions of the neighbourhood. So
there is invariably a great demand. And when
the crop is small, why the prioe goes so much
the higher. We must all go “a-wnrting.” If not
for trade, as a sort of a picnic.
I let it be known that a guide was required
to point ont the most fruitful places. Three
applicants for the post came running upon
each other’s heels—“girt” Jack Bawdon,
little Tommy Steer, and Priscilla Baker, who
arrived breathless, bnt three yards in front.
Priscilla, in my eyes, is not a beauty. She is
fair and florid, with hair like tow, and a broad
open face that beams ingenuous innocence I
admired Prisoilla for this nnmixed candour.
After all why not engage all three 1 They will
be company for each other, and children are
not reticent of their psychology.
“Well, what is the fee 1”
Prisoilla iB bnt twelve, and yonnger than
“girt” Jack Bawdon, who by unconscious
association of ideas leads the mind to think of
baoou; but she constituted herself spokes-
woman at once.
“Be we to have our keep 1”
"Certainly.”
“Be we to piok vor ee, or only to show ee
about l”
“To piok for me,” I replied at a venture.
"I have a-picked a peek,” refle ted Prisoilla.
“Bnt then they was plenty. What would ee
zay to a shil'on a piece 1”
"Very well that will----”
“Or one an’ a penny,” interrupted Prisoilla
with convinotion.
We agreed upon that The odd penny seem-
ed to give dignity to the transaction. It
raised a mere oommon wage to a professional
honorarium. So now we had only to deoide
where to go. “Girt” Jack Bawdon shouted ont,
“Why, Winsford Common, to bo sure," But a
bit of a frown puckered Prisoilla’s brow, and
her thick red lips pnt on a pout “I should say
Withypool Moor,” cried she. To WithypooJ
Moor we went.
We began with a mile of lane. Bnt a glorious
lane between walled barks with sheltering
beech hedgerows high above. On either hand
were bright green ferns and taU purple fox-
gloves, to which great bnmble-bees paid visita,
buzzing from flower to flower all up the taper
ing stem, and silent only when they orept
within to drink, Wild strawberries, with deep
orimson fruit, sprang from the orevioes, and
hang ripeniDg over the mossy stones. Wild
raspberries, too, on Lilliputian oanes, drawing
an ancestry, it may be, from bird carried seed
of a more onltnred stock, flourished in profu-
sion. “Ah ( They do beat the garden ones
holler,” cried Priscilla, “That they do.” And
she held ont h»lf-a-do*<m on her brown palm.
Otat it the shad/ lane, by a narrow pathway
np the slope, where bracken grows waist-high
after the old heather has been bnmt off, we
olimbed to the ridge of the open, breezy moor..
Masses of pnrple heather and the paler-oolonr-
ed ling were in foil flower; and growing
amongst them, and intermingled everywhere,
was the little dark green myrtle-shaped leaf
that halfoonoeals a berry almost the sire of
a black currant, and ooverad with a thicker
bloom than the wild sloe. Honeybees wive
hamming on all side*, and butterflies went
flitting by in tht inn. Upon the lyrQwn hill-
side of next ridge was passing the dark shadow
of an Angast thundercloud.
We picked and picked, stopping only when
some incident was thought worthy of my
attention. Priscilla’s eyes were the quickest.
She first took note of the buzzard circling with
outspread rounded wings on his way aoross
the moor. She saw the raven too, which
•'girt” Jaok Bawdon said was nothing bnt
a crow. Bnt little Tommy Steer was the
hero of the day. He oame upon an adder
half asleep aoross a tuft of dry grass, and not
having a stick, stamped on it with his hob-nailed
boot. “Lank, nasty girt thing !” cried Prisoilla,
as we gathered ronnd to look at the black
diamonds down his back.
At noon we unanimously agreed to invest-
igate the keep. We sat oat of the son beside a
stack of brown turves set np to dry. Most of
onr fingers were pnrple with the juioe of the
whortleberies. So were three pairs of lips. In
the landscape we conld see the whitewashed
village whence we oame.
“What are yon all going to be when yon
grow up 1”
“I shan’t bide here,” said “girt” Jaok
Bawdon.
“Ne’et I,” cried Prisoilla. “Why what is but
woods an’ moors and a river a-runnen all the
wiok alike V ■
“I ihall go in the Lnnnon p’lioe when I be a
man,” declared little Tommy Steer.
At one end of the village, nnnotioed as yon
pass the street, are two oottages. The doors
are broken, the windows are gone, there are ,
holes in the roo£ and weeds growing on the
thatch. The population has been dwindling for J
years
After all we only picked a quart apiece. Bnt |
as Prisoilla said, “Yon never can’t tell. Maybe '
we ought to ’a-went to Winsford a’ter alL”
I Wherever she may go that girl ia destined to
get on in life. She went to Winsford for herselt
the next day and picked a peck.

GOALS.
A BROKEN-DOWN 3YSTEM.
This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors
give many names, but which few of them really
understand. It is simply weakness—a fayeak-down,
asit were, of the vital forces that sustainthe system.
No matter what may be its causes (for they are al-
most numberless), its symptomsaremuch the same:
the more prominent being sleeplessness, tease of
prostration nr weariness, depression:of spirits and
want of energy for all the ord'nary affairs of life.
Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such
cases is increased vitality—vigour—
VITAL STRENGTH & ENERGY
to throw oft these morbid feelings, and experience
proves that as night succeed.-* the day this may ba
more certainly secured by a course of the cele-
brated life-reriving tonic

than by Any other known combination. So sorely
as it is taken in accordance with the printed
directions accompanying it, will the shattered
health be restored,

valueless. This wonderful medicament it purely
yegetahle and innocuous, is agreeable to the tasta
—suitable for all constitutions and conditions, in
cither sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of
disease or derangement, whose main features are
those of debility, that will not be speedily and
permanently benefited by this never-ailing recu-
perative essence, which is destined to cast into
oblivion everything that had preceded it for this
widespread andnnmerousclassof hum an ailments.
